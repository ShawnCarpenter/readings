# Clean code chapter 2 names

names should be:
- Meaningful
- Unique
- Pronouncable

>> One difference between a smart programmer and a professional programmer is that
the professional understands that clarity is king. Professionals use their powers for good
and write code that others can understand.

Class Names should be nouns  
Function names should be verbs

Names are magic, once you name a thing you can control it.

# Classes

Classes are special functions that create objects.
