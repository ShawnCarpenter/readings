# SQL Joins

To combine data from multiple tables you use a JOIN.

Joins have multiple types.
The most common is the `INNER JOIN` it returns data from both tables where a value is the same. Usually this is the primary key in one table and a foreign key in the other.

A `LEFT JOIN` returns data from both tables that matches and all the data from te first table.

There are different types of data models.
One to one matches one item to one other item.

A one to many model matches one item to multiple other items.

A many to many model matches multiple things to multiple other things.
