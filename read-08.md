# HTTP, Rest, and DNS

HTTP is the protocol used for the world wide web.

HTTP conversations consist of a request and a response.
The client  sends a request to a server and the server responds with the requested information or an error message.

DNS is the address book of the internet. It translates human readable names to computer readable IP addresses.
