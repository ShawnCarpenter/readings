# Composition vs Inheritance

Cool, I didn't realize you could pass react components as props to other components. Of course when I think about it that's what we were doing with router, so we have been doing that. 
Apparently Facebook has opinions on whether to use composition or inheritance:
>>So What About Inheritance?
At Facebook, we use React in thousands of components, and we havenâ€™t found any use cases where we would recommend creating component inheritance hierarchies.

So the winner is composition.
