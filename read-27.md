# React props and state

`setState()` is 'The One True Way' to update component state.You can pass functions as well as objects to `setState()`

Lists of sibling components need unique keys in order for React to know how to render elements when there are changes.

You can typecheck props in order to make sure the values you are passing a component are the correct type. THis can catch many bugs.


React apps are just collections of components, each component gets an object called props sent to it.
