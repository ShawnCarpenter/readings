# express routing and supertest

Express routing is how the endpoints in an express app respond to client requests. There are different route methods that correspond to the http methods(get, post, put, patch, etc...)

Supertest allows you to test your http functions. 

Express middleware is what we have been writing without knowing it. 
Express has middleware modules that are maintained by the team and there are also third-party middleware packages that can be used.
