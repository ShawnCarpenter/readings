# TDD

## Promises

Promises are a way of letting asynchronous functions return a value.
Promises can be pending (the operation is in process and hasn't passed or failed), fulfilled (the operation has completed successfully), or rejected (the operation failed)

## Destructuring
Destructuring allows you to extract individual values from arrays or properties from objects.


## Spread
Spread allows you to expand an Array or Object 
## Rest

I read all this but haven't written it down.
